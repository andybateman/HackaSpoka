# HackaSpoka

Hacking an Ikea Spoka for my son, adding the functionality of a GloClock

I bought an Ikea SPÃ–KA (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30150984/) for my son to scare the monsters away. Orinially the Spoka could just glow blue/green , I wanted it to do more.

HackaSpoka v1 (all about the hardware):

Simply has the little guy glowing blue but will cycle through an RGB colour wheel when pressed. Can have its firmware upgraded OTA from the Arduino IDE.

## Features

* Replaced the three blue/green LEDs with three full RGB LEDs
* Replaced the microprcessor with an ESP8266 (esp-12e package)
* Added WIFI, everything has to have WIFI
* Replaced the power jack with a micro USB connector
