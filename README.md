# HackaSpoka

Hacking an Ikea Spoka for my son, adding the functionality of a GloClock

I bought an Ikea SPÃ–KA (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30150984/) for my Son to scare the monsters away. Originally the Spoka could just glow blue/green , I wanted it to do more.

HackaSpoka v1.5 (all about the hardware):
